# BIM flavour combinations

With combinations of flavours we hope means that there is something for everybody - we are stilL building the menu. OpenBIM is obviously the dish of the day (and the future). Ah crap, or this might be good ... I have just found a parallel repo with the same aims as this one that looks great and can be found here [Awesome BIM](https://mitevpi.github.io/awesome-bim/). Its a great overview too.
